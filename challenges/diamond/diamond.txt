line = ('A'..input.to_a.legnth * 2) - 1

make array of size to fit 'A' to input and back, so (n * 2) - 1

index = array.center

the first line put 'A' at `index`
  index += 1
  put 'B' in index of line 2
    index += 1
    put 'C' in index of line 3
    ...
    reverse! each line
    repeat


- we need a collection of lines
  diamond = [[]]
  line = the inner arrays


in the end join each line with "/n" and add "/n" to end of last line
